## Project Description
#
For the project, we had to create a game with the following requirements: 
* Two player game
* Win state
* Lose state
* A way to keep playing if the game is not over
* Multiple rounds to play 
  * A round must begin, end, and there must be a way to check if the game should continue or the overall game is won or lost 

Based on the project requirements, I decided to create an online mancala game that someone could play on their own against a computer. The game follows the traditional rules of mancala. The player and the computer would take turns making a move until the end of the game. The game would be over once one of the rows on the board is empty of beans. At the end of the game, the beans collected by each mancala would be tallied and the one with the highest number would be the winner.

## Future Plans
# 
There are more features that I wanted to include in this game. Due to time, I was not able to add in all of the following features. 

#### Add options
* Playing against another person instead of just the computer
* Add easy, medium and hard level options if computer option is picked  
    * This prospect is exciting because it would be fun to try to create an algorithm where the computer could strategize during the game play. But, I do realize at the moment that I need more practice with algorithms in general to be able to navigate the best way to achieve this. 

#### Animation
* I would like to animate the movement of the beans on the board
    * This feature would allow the user to see more clearly what happens when their opponent makes a move or user themseleves makes a move

#### Interaction
* I would like to add more interaction in the game. 
    * For example: Being able to drag and drop stolen beans into their own mancala

#### Customization
