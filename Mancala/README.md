## Project Description
***
For the project, we had to create a game with the following requirements: 
* Two player game
* Win state
* Lose state
* A way to keep playing if the game is not over
* Multiple rounds to play 
  * A round must begin, end, and there must be a way to check if the game should continue or the overall game is won or lost 

Based on the project requirements, I decided to create an online mancala game that someone could play on their own against a computer. The game follows the traditional rules of mancala. The player and the computer would take turns making a move until the end of the game. The game would be over once one of the rows on the board is empty of beans. At the end of the game, the beans collected by each mancala would be tallied and the one with the highest number would be the winner.
